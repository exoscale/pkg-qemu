Subject: [PATCH] exec: set map length to zero when returning NULL
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When mapping physical memory into host's virtual address space,
'address_space_map' may return NULL if BounceBuffer is in_use.
Set and return '*plen = 0' to avoid later NULL pointer dereference.
