kFreeBSD has stub utimensat() up to version 9.  Without
this change qemu configure "thinks" that the system has
utimensat support and tries to use (CPP) symbols which
comes in system headers together with utimensat(),
namely UTIME_OMIT and UTIME_NOW, but thoes are not
defined.

The same applies to pipe2() call.

Since qemu 2.9 there is no clear way to go without utimensat

    9pfs: assume utimensat() and futimens() are present

    The utimensat() and futimens() syscalls have been around for ages (ie,
    glibc 2.6 and linux 2.6.22), and the decision was already taken to
    switch to utimensat() anyway when fixing CVE-2016-9602 in 2.9.
